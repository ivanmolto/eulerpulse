## Tech Stack

This project uses [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/) as a data provider.

Additionally, Euler Pulse uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Recharts](https://recharts.org/), [Tanstack React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), and [Motion](https://motion.dev/).

## Set up Next + TypeScript + TailwindCSS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
